# react-wizardary-roadmap: Conditional Rendering
In this magical example:

1. The MagicalContent component uses conditional rendering to display different messages based on whether the wizard has a wand.

2. The WizardingApp component manages a state variable hasWand with the help of the useState hook, indicating whether the wizard currently possesses a wand.

3.Clicking the button toggles the value of hasWand, and the content of the magical message changes accordingly.
