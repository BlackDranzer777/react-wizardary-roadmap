In this example:

1. useState is used to track the currentCreature.
2. useEffect simulates encountering a new magical creature. The effect runs once on mount and randomly selects a creature from the array.
3. The component displays a message based on whether there's a magical creature encountered or not.

Now, every time you mount the component, a random magical creature will appear!
